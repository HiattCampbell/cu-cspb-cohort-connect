#  CSPB Cohort Connect

CU CSPB Cohort Connect aims to connect current and past students in CU's computer science post-bacc program.

## Project Proposal
### Vision Statement
My goal with this project is to learn Java and apply that knowledge by building and deploying a full-stack web application that connects current and past students in the post-baccalaureate program. Using the associated Java framework Spring Boot and the build tool Maven, I will create a platform where students can share resources, host study events, and connect in an environment independent of professors. The app will also help past students stay in contact with not only each other, but set up potential mentor opportunities with current students. This will be an open-source project, so once I am finished with the semester, I am hoping management could be passed down to current students. 

### Motivation
I appreciate the emphasis this class places on networking, but I will be graduating after this semester, so I want to undertake a project that demonstrates my programming abilities and repository management skills, while also building connections with other students. I am choosing to learn Java and build my project in the language, because of its prevalence in the tech industry.

### Deliverables
I. Become sufficient at programming Java

*Deliverable:* Design and build a back-end API that is able to appropriately interact with an SQL database using Java and its frameworks. 

II. Build a front-end in React and utilize SQL to connect the front-end to the back-end

*Deliverable:* Have an interactive user interface front-end tied that allows users to perform the appropriate CRUD operations on an SQL database. 

III. Utilize AWS tools to deploy a full-stack web application

*Deliverable:* Successfully create a continuous integration/deployment environment using CodeDeploy, an AWS deployment automation tool. 

IV. Network with other students and encourage them to use the platform

*Deliverable:* Have several active student users in the last weeks of class. This could be analyzed by a traffic tool like Google Analytics. 

### Risks to project completion, possibly including:
#### I. New language and frameworks

I have never programmed in Java or used its frameworks and build tools. Additionally, I have never worked with AWS deployment tools that require an EC2 instance, which could add overhead to the project. 

#### II. Undertaking building an entire full-stack website within 45 hours 

Designing and building a full-stack site takes a lot of time. Making all of the moving pieces (front-end, back-end, database) fit together can be a challenge even without a time constraint. 

### Mitigation strategy for the risks listed above

#### Risk I Mitigation 

- I have a lot of experience with other object oriented languages. The similarities between languages I do know (JavaScript, C++, C) will help me pick up the language quickly.  
- My professional background as a web developer will allow me to spend less time learning front-end tools like React and  more time learning Java and its frameworks.

#### Risk II Mitigation 

- Diligently following the timeline Iâ€™ve included below will allow me to use my time efficiently and avoid falling behind.

### Project assessments - provide a list of evaluation criteria for the project
- The website is deployed and live. 
- The website is interactive on the front-end and allows users to perform CRUD operations on the database. 
- The website employs a Java back-end to interact with the SQL database. 
- Classmates are able to use the website to interact with one another. 

### Timeline
Week 2-3: Learn Java and Spring Boot, start initial planning for front-end design

Week 4-5: Database design and Spring Boot initialization, finalize front-end design

Week 6-7: User management and auth (Spring Boot Security with JWT)

Week 8-9: CRUD events 

Week 10-11: Build frontend and API integration

Week 12-13: Deploy and polish
